# WordOut Infographic

The article which was seen [here](https://www.statista.com/chart/5337/top-10-us-online-properties/), was an old article talking about Verizon extending is digital reach. It talks about the top ten most used platforms as of June 2016, which is quite interesting given it is 2020 now and I wanted to see how things have changed. For example you can see Google sites is more used then Facebook, and that Yahoo is the third most used and AOL is #7. What also is interesting is that during the time this article went out, AOL and Yahoo was just acquired and now barely anybody uses AOL and Yahoo to the extent that it was years ago. The main move of the acquistion was to expand Verizon's content reach potential, and this seems true given that AOL was a media powerhouse who owns TechCrunch.

Now I wanted to do a WordOut infographic in relation to this chart and article. What is more interesting in the infographic that I automatically generated, was that Verizon is obviously the biggest text, but then you have AOL and Yahoo being quite big. This is interesting not only to see how WordOut as a software works, but how text mining for metadata works in general. WordOut was able to get a sense of what this article was about. Now you see online then acquired and reached being some of the biggest texts, and so on.

I copy and pasted the text from the article related to that Statista chart to TagCloud as well, and got suprisingly similar results. TagCloud also revealed the same things going on in terms of Verizon being bold and the biggest. Then came Yahoo and AOL, and lots of emphasis was put on the words: acquired, advertising and deal. It is almost as if the writer was utilizing these words not just to ephasize how big of a deal this was, but how this would help with advertising, content generation, and Verizon's overall reach. You can see the words online and reach being the next emphasized words, and then: audience, billion, business, company, content and month. In a way, that further validates my conclusion.
